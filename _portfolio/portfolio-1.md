title: "Criticality and Entanglement in Noisy Random Quantum Circuits 1"
excerpt: "In this work, we explore Haar-random quantum circuits as a minimally structured model to study the entanglement dynamics of a 1D qubit chain. We use logarithmic negativity as an entanglement measure to see the entanglement growth in the presence of physical noise generated from the quantum gates. The numerical simulation shows that the systemâ€™s entanglement gradually switches from the Volume law phase to the Area law phase for
increasing noise rate.<br/><img src='/images/nm.png'>"
